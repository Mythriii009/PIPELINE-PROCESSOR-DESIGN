DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NELA SANTOSH

IN THIS TASK, I HAVE DESIGNED A SIMPLE 4-STAGE PIPELINED PROCESSOR USING VERILOG HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE. THE DESIGN IS DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVEN A BEGINNER CAN UNDERSTAND HOW A BASIC PIPELINED CPU WORKS. THE FOUR STAGES INCLUDED IN THIS PIPELINED PROCESSOR ARE FETCH (IF), DECODE (ID), EXECUTE (EX), AND WRITE BACK (WB). EACH STAGE OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY AND HANDLES A SPECIFIC PART OF THE INSTRUCTION EXECUTION PROCESS.

THE PROCESSOR IS CAPABLE OF EXECUTING THREE BASIC INSTRUCTIONS: ADD, SUB, AND LOAD. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE REPRESENTED IN A 16-BIT FORMAT, WHICH INCLUDES OPCODE, DESTINATION REGISTER, SOURCE REGISTER, AND AN IMMEDIATE OR OFFSET VALUE. THESE BASIC INSTRUCTIONS HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THE FLOW OF DATA THROUGH THE PIPELINE STAGES.

IN THE FETCH STAGE, THE INSTRUCTION IS FETCHED FROM THE INSTRUCTION MEMORY USING THE PROGRAM COUNTER (PC). IN THE DECODE STAGE, THE INSTRUCTION IS BROKEN DOWN INTO OPCODE, SOURCE REGISTER, DESTINATION REGISTER, AND IMMEDIATE VALUE. IN THE EXECUTE STAGE, THE ACTUAL ARITHMETIC OR MEMORY OPERATION IS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INSTRUCTION TYPE. FINALLY, IN THE WRITE BACK STAGE, THE RESULT IS STORED BACK INTO THE REGISTER FILE.

TO MAKE THE PROCESSOR WORK, WE INITIALIZED SOME SAMPLE VALUES IN REGISTERS AND MEMORY AND THEN FED SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS INTO THE INSTRUCTION MEMORY. FOR EXAMPLE, AN ADD INSTRUCTION THAT ADDS TWO REGISTER VALUES AND STORES THE RESULT IN A THIRD REGISTER. THIS WAY, WE COULD OBSERVE HOW EACH INSTRUCTION PASSES THROUGH THE FOUR PIPELINE STAGES AND HOW DATA IS MANIPULATED AT EACH STAGE.

TOOLS USED:

FOR THIS PROJECT, I USED THE ICARUS VERILOG SIMULATOR TO COMPILE AND SIMULATE THE VERILOG CODE. I USED THE COMMAND IVERILOG TO COMPILE THE VERILOG FILES AND VVP TO RUN THE SIMULATION. TO VIEW THE INTERNAL SIGNAL CHANGES OVER TIME, I USED GTKWave WHICH IS A WAVEFORM VIEWER. THIS HELPED ME TO VISUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW EACH INSTRUCTION MOVES FROM ONE STAGE TO THE NEXT IN THE PIPELINE.

EDITOR PLATFORM USED:

THE CODE WAS WRITTEN USING VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VS CODE), WHICH IS A VERY BEGINNER-FRIENDLY AND POPULAR TEXT EDITOR. I USED VERILOG EXTENSIONS IN VS CODE FOR SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING AND ERROR DETECTION. THIS MADE IT EASY TO WRITE, DEBUG, AND ORGANIZE THE CODE IN A CLEAN WAY.

APPLICATIONS OF THIS TASK:

THIS TASK IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF PIPELINING IN COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE. PIPELINING IS A KEY TECHNIQUE USED IN MOST MODERN MICROPROCESSORS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE BY EXECUTING MULTIPLE INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS SIMPLE 4-STAGE PIPELINE EXPLAINS HOW COMPLEX REAL-WORLD PROCESSORS LIKE INTEL OR ARM HANDLE INSTRUCTIONS EFFICIENTLY.

THIS TYPE OF DESIGN IS USEFUL IN ACADEMIC PROJECTS, COMPUTER ORGANIZATION COURSES, DIGITAL DESIGN LABS, AND FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BUILD A MINI CPU MODEL FOR LEARNING PURPOSES. STUDENTS CAN LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF PARALLELISM, TIMING, AND DATA HAZARDS IN PROCESSORS THROUGH SUCH EXPERIMENTS.
